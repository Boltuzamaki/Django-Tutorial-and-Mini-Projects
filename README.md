### **What Is __init__.py?**
- This file is generated by Django for us. It is mandatory to have an __inti__.py file in a directory to denote that the project is a python package and can be imported into other files. This file usually remains empty.
- If this file gets missing, you will see “package not found error” in the absence of this file.
### **What Is settings.py?**
- This is the core file of our Django projects.
- It contains the configuration values which are needed by web apps to work properly such as database settings, static files location, template location, etc. We will keep coming to this file to edit the project configuration throughout this course.
### **What is urls.py?**
- Url declaration and mapping are made under this file.
### **What is wsgi.py?**
- WSGI stands for web-server gateway interface.
- WSGI is a specification that describes the communication between a web server and a web application.
### **What is manage.py?**
- Command-line utility for performing administrative tasks.
- We will be using manage.py frequently while developing a Django project.

In project folder run
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
To start server . First server is started running successfully :)

### How Websites works
#### **Front-End:**
- It is a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

- Users can directly view and interact with this data.

- It is also referred to as client-side or frontend design.

#### **Back-end:**
- Back-end takes care of when and which webpage should be visible to the client corresponding to a given request.

- Users can not directly view or interact with this data. The back-end is all about the behind-the-scene activities.

- It is also referred to as the server-side.
